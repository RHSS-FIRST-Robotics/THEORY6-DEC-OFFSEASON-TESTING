THEORY6-DEC-OFFSEASON-TESTING
=============================

Off-season testing was done on one of our spare drivetrains from the 2014 season. New classes to generate polynomials and bezier curves for the robot to follow were created. Testing of the Command Based Template worked out well. We will switch to that for the 2015 season.
